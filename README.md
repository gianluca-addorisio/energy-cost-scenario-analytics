## Project Overview

This project develops a scenario-based analytics framework to assess how energy price uncertainty translates into corporate cost risk.

Rather than focusing on point forecasts, the framework is designed to:
- construct **plausible energy price scenarios**,
- quantify their **impact on operating costs**, and
- summarize **risk and stress outcomes** in a form suitable for decision-making.

The project targets use cases such as:
- budgeting and planning under uncertainty,
- sensitivity analysis to energy shocks,
- scenario-based risk assessment for energy-intensive firms.

## Conceptual Approach

The core idea is simple:

> Firms do not need a single “correct” energy price forecast.  
> They need to understand how different plausible price paths affect costs and risk.

Accordingly, the workflow is organized around:
1. clean and interpretable data,
2. scenario construction (baseline, adverse, upside),
3. cost impact modeling,
4. uncertainty and stress analysis.

Model complexity is intentionally kept moderate to ensure transparency and interpretability.

## Project Roadmap

The project is developed incrementally:

- **Phase 1** – Data ingestion and cleaning  
- **Phase 2** – Scenario generation and visualization  
- **Phase 3** – Cost impact modeling  
- **Phase 4** – Optional risk metrics (stress outcomes, tail analysis)

Details are documented in `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

## Intended Audience

This project is designed for:
- analytics and decision-support teams,
- risk and scenario analysis functions,
- corporate planning and strategy roles.

It is not intended as a trading or high-frequency modeling system.
