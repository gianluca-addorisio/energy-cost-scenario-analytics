# Energy Cost Scenario Analytics
Scenario-based energy cost and risk analytics for corporate decision-making.

This project builds a transparent and reproducible analytics framework to translate
energy price uncertainty into cost and risk insights for energy-exposed firms.

---

## What this project does

- Constructs **plausible energy price scenarios** (baseline, adverse, upside)
- Quantifies their **impact on operating costs**
- Summarizes **risk and stress outcomes** for decision support

The focus is on interpretability and usability rather than point forecasting
or complex black-box models.
